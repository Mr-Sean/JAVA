This repo represents my JAVA assignments completed during my time enrolled in 
Coding Dojo's JAVA course. This JAVA course is 1 of 3 programming languages included 
in Coding Dojo's "Full-Stack" course curriculum (Python, Java & React <aka MERN>). 
I've completed all 3 courses for the 3 programming languages in the Full-Stack.

The name of this repo (& most of its folders) and its general folder structure was 
determined by the course.
